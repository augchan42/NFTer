# NFT Contract Design - Architecture Decision Record

## Context

We need to design a Sui Move contract for minting NFTs of AI-generated anime characters. The contract needs to handle metadata, minting, and collection management.

## Decision

We will implement a Sui Move contract that follows the Sui NFT standard and includes:

1. Collection management
2. Metadata handling
3. Minting functionality
4. Royalty support

## Status

Proposed

## Consequences

### Positive

- Standard-compliant NFTs
- Efficient on-chain storage
- Flexible metadata structure
- Royalty support for creators

### Negative

- Gas costs for on-chain operations
- Complexity in contract management
- Need for careful upgrade planning

## Technical Details Needed

1. Sui Move contract structure
2. Metadata schema
3. Collection organization
4. Royalty implementation
5. Upgrade mechanism

## Open Questions

1. Should we use dynamic fields for metadata?
2. How to structure the collection hierarchy?
3. What should be the upgrade strategy?
4. How to handle failed mints?
5. What should be the gas optimization strategy?

## Next Steps

1. Get Sui Move contract requirements
2. Define metadata schema
3. Design collection structure
4. Plan upgrade mechanism
5. Implement contract

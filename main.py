        Use vibrant anime-style coloring. Do not use grayscale. The composition should be centered, zoomed-in, and clean. Crop the image to a close-up portrait focused on the face and shoulders only. Avoid full body shots or wide angles.

        Use a minimal anime-style background that complements the character. Blur it slightly to keep focus on the character. Final output must be 1024x1024 resolution in full color.
